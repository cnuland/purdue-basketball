PHOENIX – When Purdue center Zach Edey checked out of the game for the final time as a Boilermaker, he walked down the bench, greeting each of his teammates in turn. He lingered on sophomore shooting guard Fletcher Loyer, the pair embracing and the departing two-time national player of the year speaking into Loyer’s ear.

After the game, Loyer, eyes rimmed with tears and his voice breaking, described the broad strokes of that conversation.

“He just said we’re gonna be special,” said Loyer, a sophomore who is part of a large group set to return next season. “I don’t know why he’s talking about next year when what we did the last two years is very impressive and I won’t ever forget it.”


Only one team can end a season truly happy. The Boilermakers had a chance to do so Monday in the national championship game – the school’s second ever and the first since 1969 – but they fell to Connecticut 75-60. That left Purdue trying to comfort itself with the knowledge that its accomplishments this season outstripped almost every other team in the 127-year history of the program.

The conclusion of a season that does not end in a championship brings with it the urge to look ahead, but, as Loyer pointed out, the Boilermakers earned the right to reflect for a while at the elite level of play it maintained across the entire 2023-24 slate.

“People don’t realize that if they were faced with this challenge, they would quit,” Loyer said. “They wouldn’t even attempt to do what we did. … There were never any incidents in this locker room. It’s difficult, a group of 17 guys to buy into something so difficult and put in so much time, so much effort physically, mentally and emotionally, it’s tough.

“I just have so much respect for the guys in this room, the coaching staff and I wouldn’t have wanted to make the Final Four, national championship with anyone else.”

And Purdue did not simply reach the national championship game, as program-changing as that accomplishment might turn out to be. In addition, the Boilermakers were one of the most consistent teams in the country all season. They spent the entire campaign ranked in the top five and have been in the top five for 37 consecutive polls over the last two campaigns, 17 more than any other active streak.

Purdue began the season with a Maui Invitational title, emerging from one of the best fields in the history of the premier early-season event with wins over Gonzaga, Tennessee and Marquette, all eventual Sweet 16 teams. The Boilers added a victory over No. 1 Arizona, their first triumph against a top-ranked team in 23 years, and another against eventual Final Four participant Alabama at the end of a brutal nonconference schedule. The Boilers went undefeated out of conference in the regular season for the third consecutive campaignand have not lost a non-conference game outside the NCAA Tournament since December 2020.

They barely slowed down in the Big Ten, winning a record 26th league title and second in a row, both coming by three games over the field.


Add in Purdue’s run to its first Final Four since 1980 and the Boilers set a program record with 34 wins, four more than the last mark. They won those games facing a schedule KenPom.com’s metrics considered the second-toughest in college basketball since 2001.

In many years, they would have been the best team in the country, but Connecticut fielded one of the most dominant teams in recent memory to eclipse them.

“This s--- hurts,” coach Matt Painter told his team in the locker room after the loss to the Huskies. “We had a chance to win a national championship. You’re going to look up (in the rafters) and see a runner-up national championship and you’re gonna be like, ‘Damn.’

“But no one’s going to look up there and say, ‘Damn, I didn’t give it my best.’ Everybody in here did that. I know it’s hard to take, but when you’re walking out of here, keep your head up high.”

Purdue’s accomplishments are arguably even more impressive in light of what came before – a loss as a No. 1 seed in the first round of last spring’s NCAA Tournament, just the second such defeat ever.

After three consecutive excellent seasons ended in losses to double-digit seeds during March Madness, the Boilermakers absorbed all doubts about their ability to turn regular-season success into a deep tournament run and won their first five tournament games by an average of 19.6 points.

“That we’re a damn good team,” guard Lance Jones said of what his team learned in the tournament. “We proved it a lot of the doubters wrong. A lot of people didn’t believe us, didn’t think we’d make it this far. But the inner circle stayed together, we worked and we made it as far as we could.”

With team success came individual accolades – consensus national player of the year honors for Edey, Big Ten Sixth Man of the Year for Mason Gillis, a spot on the list of five finalists for the Bob Cousy Award – given to the best point guard in the country – for sophomore Braden Smith.

The Boilermakers will be different next season with Edey, Gillis, Jones and Ethan Morton departing and a ballyhooed six-man freshman class coming in, headlined by top-40 national recruit Kanon Catchings. They won’t look forward for a while, but when they do, they’ll see a bright future.

“You get an eyelash away from winning it all, that’s the standard,” Painter said. “Those guys (coming back) are going to be getting into the gym, fighting, competing. We like our young guys that are coming in next year, so we’re excited.”
